# YREC Token Project

**Production-Ready** Yield-indexed IP Rights Exposure Certificate (YREC) token with simple mint/burn functionality for custodial operations.

## Overview

This project contains the production-ready smart contract for Yield-indexed IP Rights Exposure Certificate (YREC) token:
- **YRECTokenSimple.sol**: Main ERC20 token with simple mint/burn functionality ‚úÖ **Production Ready**
- **YRECTimelock.sol**: Governance timelock contract (6-hour delay) ‚úÖ **Production Ready**  
- **SimpleMultisig.sol**: Basic multisig wallet for testnet fallback ‚úÖ **Production Ready**

## Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Security
- **Standard OpenZeppelin Implementation**: Battle-tested ERC20 with minimal modifications
- **Role-based Access Control**: Granular permissions with OpenZeppelin AccessControl
- **Implementation Protection**: `_disableInitializers()` prevents hijacking
- **Pausable Operations**: Emergency pause functionality
- **Non-transferable**: Only mint/burn operations allowed

### üèõÔ∏è Governance
- **6-hour Timelock**: Required delays for mint/burn operations
- **UUPS Upgradeable**: Immediate upgrade pattern via role-based control
- **Role-based Control**: UPGRADER_ROLE, PAUSER_ROLE, WHITELIST_MANAGER_ROLE
- **Custodial Safe**: All tokens minted to designated safe wallet
- **Emergency Functions**: Immediate pause/unpause and admin controls

### üìã Compliance & Operations
- **Whitelist Management**: KYC-controlled addresses with batch operations
- **Mint Only to Safe**: Tokens can only be minted to whitelisted custodial safe wallet
- **Burn Only from Safe**: Tokens can only be burned from whitelisted custodial safe wallet
- **No Transfers**: Regular transfers between addresses are blocked
- **Clean Interface**: Simple mint(amount) and burn(amount) functions

## Contract Architecture

### YRECTokenSimple.sol (Production Contract)
```solidity
// Main features:
- Simple ERC20 with timelock-controlled mint/burn to whitelisted custodial safe
- Role-based access control (UPGRADER_ROLE, PAUSER_ROLE, WHITELIST_MANAGER_ROLE)
- Whitelist management with batch operations (max 500 addresses)
- Timelock integration for mint/burn operations (6-hour delay)
- UUPS upgradeable pattern (immediate upgrades via role control)
- Pausable operations
- Non-transferable (blocks all transfers except mint/burn)
- Implementation protection
```

### Security Model
1. **Timelock Governance** ‚Üí 6-hour delay for mint/burn operations
2. **Immediate Upgrades** ‚Üí Role-based contract upgrades for operational flexibility
3. **Role-based Access** ‚Üí UPGRADER_ROLE, PAUSER_ROLE, WHITELIST_MANAGER_ROLE control
4. **Whitelist Control** ‚Üí KYC compliance with batch operations
5. **Custodial Safe** ‚Üí Only whitelisted address that can hold tokens
6. **No Transfers** ‚Üí Prevents unauthorized token movement
7. **Standard Pattern** ‚Üí OpenZeppelin battle-tested implementation

### Contract Functions

#### Core Functions
- `mint(uint256 amount)` - Mints tokens to custodial safe (TIMELOCK REQUIRED - 6h delay)
- `burn(uint256 amount)` - Burns tokens from custodial safe (TIMELOCK REQUIRED - 6h delay)
- `pause()` / `unpause()` - Emergency controls (PAUSER_ROLE - immediate)

#### Whitelist Functions
- `updateWhitelist(address, bool)` - Add/remove address from whitelist (WHITELIST_MANAGER_ROLE)
- `batchUpdateWhitelist(address[], bool)` - Batch whitelist update (max 500 addresses)
- `isWhitelisted(address)` - Check if address is whitelisted

#### View Functions
- `custodialSafe()` - Returns the custodial safe address
- `timelock()` - Returns the timelock contract address
- `totalSupply()` - Returns total token supply
- `balanceOf(address)` - Returns balance (only custodial safe will have balance)

#### Admin Functions
- `updateCustodialSafe(address)` - Updates custodial safe address (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
- `updateTimelock(address)` - Updates timelock address (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)

## Contract Verification

### Verify on Plume Explorer
After deployment, verify the contract:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network plume-mainnet <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS>
```

## Usage Flow

1. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy YRECTokenSimple with initial owner, custodial safe, and timelock
2. **Platform Calculations**: Your platform calculates required YREC supply based on IP portfolio
3. **Create Timelock Proposal**: Generate timelock proposal for mint/burn operations
4. **Submit to Timelock**: Submit proposal to timelock contract via Gnosis Safe
5. **Wait 6 Hours**: Timelock enforces 6-hour delay for security
6. **Execute Proposal**: Execute the timelock proposal to mint/burn tokens
7. **Supply Updated**: On-chain supply now matches platform calculations
